        <h2 style="color:palevioletred;">Why I want a Dog</h2>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">I was never allowed to have large pets growing up because we always lived in an apartment. I had a few fish that would die after a week or two. I was never sad about it because I knew it would happen. I really hope to have a dog one day so I can have a furry companion. All of my friends have dogs.</p>

        <p style="font-family: cursive;">I want a weiner dog because they are the perfect size for me. They are small enough to take anywhere. They are so cute when the wobble. I want one with long hair and one with short hair.</p>
